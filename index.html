        <h1>Backpacking – How to Pack the Backpack</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="grid">
        <p>My first multi-day backpacking trip was with the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) where we were taught a system of packing a backpack that I have never strayed from over the last three years. The method is simple, keeps important items dry, and allows for saving space to pack as much as you can in such a confined space. Choosing a backpack, using a trash bag liner, where to put group gear and food and rain gear, and how to use the annexed parts of the backpack (brain, side pockets, front pockets) are critical to organization on trail.</p>

                <h2>THE BOTTOM</h2>
                <img src="./assets/Placeholder.mp4">
                <p>Rain protection can be tricky and expensive. There’s no need for a rain resistant pack as long as you put the important items in the bottom of the bag first lined with a trash bag. Your sleep system, camp clothes, and any puffy gear you don’t have out during the hike should be stored here. Instead of folding items, push them tightly into air pockets around the sleeping bag and pad, this helps save space. When everything is tightly packed in, fold the top of the trash bag over into itself and tuck the edges to prevent rain from seeping in. Carry an extra bag with you for trips longer than a week (they’ll always get a bit beat up, make sure you have a backup).</p>

                <h2>THE MIDDLE</h2>
                <img src="./assets/Placeholder.mp4">
                <p>Group gear, pots, pans, and food items not needed while hiking get packed together. Put heavier items like the cooking gear towards the back panel of the bag to maintain your center of gravity near your core. Soft food items like tortillas can get placed within pans to protect them and other food items can get stashed into air pockets around the exterior wall of the bag and in the center.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h2>THE TOP</h2>
                <img src="./assets/Placeholder.mp4">
                <p>Rain gear and quick grab items go hear. I’ll shove my rain pants and jacket down the sides, then things like the dry bag I use for my camera and other gadgets I don’t need super accessible can go on top. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h2>THE BRAIN</h2>
                <img src="./assets/Placeholder.mp4">
                <p>Maps, compasses, snacks, headlamp, water filtration, and any other small items you’ll need access to on breaks or periodically through the hike can go here. The brain compartment often has two zipper pockets, so you can organize like items further this way. Also consider what is easier to access for you versus somebody you are hiking with, they may be able to grab items for you if a packs-off break isn’t on the table.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h2>POCKETS</h2>
                <img src="./assets/Placeholder.mp4">
                <p>Quick access items to help keep you moving like snacks can get stored here. Most packs should have one on both sides and you may find a different combination of items helpful. Think of what you may need without being able to stop on trail and keep those items here. Water bottles or tall fuel canisters can get placed in your side pockets. Try to keep these balanced as water adds significant weight – your body will notice the difference.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h2>OUTSIDE TRINKETS</h2>
                <img src="./assets/Placeholder.mp4">
                <p>Use ropes and carabiners to attach extra items like shoes, hats, sleeping pads (if you have a foam fold up one and not an inflatable), or camp chairs to the outside back of your pack. Get creative and make sure things are secure – if you’re at the back of the hiking group you may not notice if things fall off. Do a periodic check or have your hiking mates take a look to make sure nothing got loose. Always attach your Garmin or SOS beacon to the straps of your backpack near your chest (some packs have pockets here you can tuck the unit into or just let it be clipped). In the event of an emergency, you’ll want this accessible. When crossing a river where you need to unclip your bag in the event of a fall, take time to place the Garmin or SOS beacon on your person and secure it so that you will not lose that too.</p>
